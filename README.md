# Method for Integrated Microphone Pressure Frequency Response Measurement Using a Probe Microphone (IMPro)
IMPro method to measure the pressure sensitivity frequency response of an integrated microphone device is proposed. The measurement can be conducted in a normal office environment rather than under anechoic conditions. 

## Equipment:
The equipment required for the IMPro measurement consists of signal acquisition hardware, a reference microphone, a probe microphone, a loudspeaker, and mechanical hardware to reliably position the probe microphone's tip at the required position.

* Probe microphone & GRAS 40SA
* Reference microphone & B\&K 4136
* Loudspeaker & Genelec 8010A
* Microphone PSU & B\&K 2829
* Acquisition hardware & RME UFX
* Microphone stands & K\&M 201A/2
* Stereo T-bar & K\&M 23550
* Tripod universal ball-joint & K\&M 19695
* Dial gauge positioning arm & Noga MG60103
* Thread adapter M8 to \micThread~-16 UNC & Custom
* Probe microphone holder & 3-D printed part

### Probe microphone holder & 3-D printed part:
IMPro method uses a probe microphone to measure the pressure at microphone close to opening of the microphone inlet port. The placement of the probe microphone can be simpler with a help of probe positioning device to displace the probe tip along the probe tube axis.
